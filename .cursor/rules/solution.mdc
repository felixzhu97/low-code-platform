# Low-Code Platform Solution

## Purpose

This rule captures the **business challenges** the Felix low-code platform addresses and the **solution strategy** (capabilities and principles). Use it to:

- Align new features with platform goals
- Prioritize work by solution impact
- Avoid scope creep or misaligned functionality
- Guide architecture and UX decisions

## Business Challenges

| #   | Challenge                                                                                | Impact                                         |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Slow delivery** — Long cycles from idea to live page (design → dev → deploy)           | Delayed time-to-market, high iteration cost    |
| 2   | **Design–dev gap** — Handoff friction, design drift, rework                              | Rework, miscommunication, poor design fidelity |
| 3   | **High technical barrier** — Non-devs can’t build; front-end talent scarce/expensive     | Bottlenecks, cost, limited who can ship        |
| 4   | **Data–UI integration complexity** — APIs, validation, charts, forms require custom code | More dev effort, bugs, duplication             |
| 5   | **Collaboration & versioning** — Multi-user edits, conflicts, no clear history           | Merge hell, blame, rollback pain               |
| 6   | **Design-to-production gap** — Prototypes don’t become deployable apps                   | Waste, duplication, deployment friction        |
| 7   | **Inconsistency & low reuse** — Ad-hoc components, no shared themes/templates            | Inconsistent UX, high maintenance              |

## Solution Pillars

### 1. Visual-first, fast iteration

- **Drag-and-drop canvas** — Add, move, nest, delete components without code.
- **Real-time preview** — WYSIWYG; no separate preview mode for basic checks.
- **Templates** — Start from templates (login, dashboard, forms, etc.) instead of blank.
- **AI generation** — Natural-language → components/pages to speed up creation.

**Guiding question:** Does this change help designers iterate faster with less code?

### 2. Design–dev bridge

- **Design in editor** — Designers produce real, editable layouts and bindings, not static mockups.
- **Export clean code** — React/Next.js export for developers to integrate and extend.
- **Schema in/out** — Export/import schema (JSON) for tooling, versioning, and reuse.

**Guiding question:** Does this keep “design as source of truth” while staying dev-friendly?

### 3. Lower technical barrier

- **Config over code** — Properties, themes, layout via UI; minimal scripting.
- **Curated component library** — Base, layout, form, chart components; predictable APIs.
- **Guided data binding** — Connect static/API data to components via config, not custom code.

**Guiding question:** Can a page designer succeed without writing component logic?

### 4. Data-aware building

- **Data sources** — Static (JSON) and API; validate, preview, refresh.
- **Binding UX** — Map fields to components; support lists, transforms, formatting.
- **Charts & forms** — Chart config + form builder + validation (e.g. Zod) without hand-written wiring.

**Guiding question:** Does this reduce custom data-fetching and validation code?

### 5. Collaboration & history

- **Real-time collaboration** — Multi-user editing, presence, basic conflict handling.
- **History** — Undo/redo, version snapshots, restore.
- **Conflict handling** — Detect conflicts, support merge or overwrite strategies.

**Guiding question:** Does this make multi-user editing and rollback reliable and understandable?

### 6. Design-to-production path

- **Export** — React components, full Next.js app, optional Git push.
- **Deploy** — Scripts/config for Docker, Vercel, Netlify, etc.; AWS integration where relevant.
- **Config over hardcode** — Env, feature flags, etc. where applicable.

**Guiding question:** Does this shorten the path from “done in editor” to “live in production”?

### 7. Consistency & reuse

- **Theming** — Global theme; presets; light/dark.
- **Custom components** — Save compositions as components; group, import/export.
- **Templates** — Shared template library; save, apply, customize.

**Guiding question:** Does this reduce duplication and keep visual/UX consistency?

## Development Guidance

### When adding features

1. **Map to challenges** — Which of the 7 challenges does this reduce? If none, validate need.
2. **Map to pillars** — Which pillar(s) does it support? Keep the mapping explicit in ADRs/PRs.
3. **Respect layers** — Follow Clean Architecture (see `clean-architecture.mdc`); domain first, then application, then infrastructure/presentation.

### When prioritizing

- Prefer work that touches **multiple pillars** or **high-impact challenges** (e.g. slow delivery, design–dev gap).
- Avoid features that deepen technical debt or add one-off, non-reusable behavior.

### When designing UX

- Prefer **config over code** for designers.
- Keep **exported code** and **schema** clean, readable, and stable.
- Preserve **undo/redo** and **versioning** semantics for collaborative editing.
